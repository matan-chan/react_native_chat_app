## getting started

The app made out of a frontend made out of react native and a backend made out of node js server and mongodb database.
first create a database and name it `chat_database` and add to it a new collection named `chats_table` then u need to add 
the data in (look at the example below). Don't forget to run mongodb on port 27017.
